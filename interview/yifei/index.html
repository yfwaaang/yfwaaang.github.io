<h1>Yifei Wang</h1>

<h2>Tell me about yourself. Name, where you're from, school major, age?</h2>

<p>I am Yifei from China, I am a transfer student in the fashion department. I don't want to talk about age. </p>

<h2>What do you like to do on a free day?</h2>

<p>I walk around the city without a clear destination, I like to discover unknown spots that are interesting.</p>

<h2>What is something unique about yourself?</h2>

<p>I like spicy food a lot.<p>

<h2>What are your favorite things in NYC?</h2>

<p>Gallery openings, book fairs and clubbing.</p>

<h2>If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be? Why?</h2>

<p>If I could live anywhere in the world, I would want to live in the Oia Village in Santorini, Greece. I'm fascinated by Greek history and art, and it's beautiful there.</p>
