<h1>Carol Chong</h1>

<h2>Where are you from?</h2>

<p>I am from a very tiny but beautiful island of Guam. Guam is an U.S. territory that not a lot of people know about. A lot of people go to Guam for vacation because of the beautiful beaches and sunsets</p>

<h2>Tell me about your family.</h2>

<p>My mom is the very responsible one. She takes care of all of us and makes sure we have delicious food on the table and makes sure we are healthy and happy everyday.

My dad is the goofy one. He makes sure we all have smiles on our faces and he makes us laugh all the time. He also makes sure me and my sister are growing up as good individuals, trying to teach us from what's right and wrong.

My sister is the one I annoy but I know she still loves me. We don't talk too much, but when I need her she is always there for me. She gives me great advice and makes sure I am okay.</p>

<h2>Do you prefer books, movies, or TV shows? What are you favorites?</h2>

<p>As of right now, I prefer TV Shows. I don't have one favorite TV Show, but as of right now, my favorite TV Shows are: "Friends", "Saved by the Bell", "Bob's Burgers", "Pretty Little Liars", "Freaks and Geeks", and "Bones".<p>

<h2>If you could have any super power, what would it be?</h2>

<p>If I could have any superpower, it would be to teleport. I would choose teleportation because it would allow me to get to my home in Guam and New York in seconds, while on the plane it would take about a day to get there.</p>

<h2>Where do you want to travel to next, and what will you do there?</h2>

<p>I would like to travel to somewhere I've never been to, like China, India, Rio, London, etc. I would like to just experience the different cultures that they offer and experience and learn from other people.</p>
