<h1>Varun Vig</h1>

<h2>What is your favorite movie?</h2>

<p>I would say "Never Back Down", or "Step Up".</p>

<p>Travelled, spent time with family and friends, ate, partied, slept, and worked.</p>

<h2>What is your favorite food?</h2>

<p>Italian.<p>

<h2>Why did you choose your major?</h2>

<p>I chose communication design because it gave me an outlet to really bring together all the different forms of art I enjoy, hence giving me the opportunity to really create something using all my skills to the max.</p>

<p>In the near future probably Machu Picchu.</p>
