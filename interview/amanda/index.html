<h1>Amanda Zaldivar</h1>

<h2>Why are you interested in Graphic Design?</h2>

<p>I'm interested in Graphic Design because I like it's mixture of art and technology. I want to learn how to build websites, create apps, and design effective logos.</p>

<h2>Who is your favorite artist? Why?</h2>

<p>My favorite artist is Frida, because I love that she embodies strength and passion, and shows it through her work. She also ties me to my heritage. She was an incredibly gifted painter.</p>

<h2>If you won $1 million, what's the first thing you would buy? Why?</h2>

<p>If I won a million dollars, I would buy a studio apartment in New York City, along with a ton of art supplies. Then I would have a private space to create freely.<p>

<h2>Why did you choose your major?</h2>

<p>I chose communication design because it seems like a stable career within the art field.</p>

<h2>If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be? Why?</h2>

<p>If I could live anywhere in the world, I would want to live in the Oia Village in Santorini, Greece. I'm fascinated by Greek history and art, and it's beautiful there.</p>
