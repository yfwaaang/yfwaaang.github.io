<h1>Javarius Jones</h1>


<p>1. Yea, but I don't get the joke.</p>

<p>2. Exactly. No time or interest.</p>

<p>3. Man?<p>

<p>4. Ha. I'm gender non-conforming so I prefer you to address me as Javarius, Java, J, Jones, or any variant of my name. OK?</p>

<p>5. Because that's what I said goddamit, and the imposition of gender binaries are destructive to human evolution. Next question.</p>

<p>6. You didn't. And even if you did, but that wasn't your intent, the impact is what matters. Rememba dat.</p>

<p>7. OK. I have to go now. It was nice meetin' you.</p>
